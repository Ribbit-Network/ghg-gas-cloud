# Parts List

The first step in building a Frog Sensor is to get all of the parts. You can find the [parts list or Bill of Materials (BOM) here.](../ribbit_network_frog_sensor_bom.csv)

The document linked above contains quantities and links to purchase all of the parts you'll need to build a Frog.

Note that there are several 3D printed parts that you'll need to 3D print yourself. The next section will cover that in more detail.

## International BOMs

If you're not located in the United States, check out alternatives BOMs that are specific to your country below. The parts are the same but prices are in a local currency and links are replaced with local supplier alternatives to avoid high shipping and import fees.
