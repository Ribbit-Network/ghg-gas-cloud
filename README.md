# Ribbit Network Frog Sensor
[This project will create the world's largest Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset that will empower anyone to join in the work on climate and provide informed data for climate action.](https://ribbitnetwork.org/)

The Greenhouse Gas Sensor Cloud is a large network of open-source, low-cost, Greenhouse Gas (CO2 and possibly methane) Detection Sensors. These sensor units will be sold by the Ribbit Network and will upload their data to the cloud, creating the world's most complete Greenhouse Gas dataset.

[See more about the cloud database here.](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-dashboard)

## Frog Sensors
Our “Frogs” are tiny sensors that you can buy and deploy at your own home! It’s a small, open-source box that measures the amount of CO2 in the air using a tiny laser.
It's easy to set up and will constantly record valuable scientific data on our climate.
Frogs are one of the species that are most affected by climate change! Just like our sensors, they ribbit to one another to create a powerful network of data about the environment.

## Current Status
The hardware and software are currently under development for the first sensor version to ship out to a growing waiting list!

The first prototype sensors are up and running in Seattle. [Here is some real data from that sensor](https://ribbit-network.herokuapp.com/) (Note this dashboard is still experimental and may be down occasionally).

[The Ship Sensor 1 Project contains the known list of most urgent work to ship out the first sensors](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-sensor/projects/1)
